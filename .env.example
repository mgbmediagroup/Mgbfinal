# Resend API Configuration
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here

# Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file to .env.local
# 2. Get your API key from https://resend.com/api-keys
# 3. Replace 'your_resend_api_key_here' with your actual API key
# 4. NEVER commit .env.local or any file containing real API keys

# Note: This is only needed for local testing of the test-resend.js script
# The production site uses Netlify Environment Variables for security
