# Favicon Setup Instructions

## Current Status
The website has been configured with favicon support, but the actual favicon images need to be replaced with the provided logo images.

## Files to Replace
Replace these placeholder files in the `public/` directory with the actual favicon images:

1. **favicon.ico** - Main favicon file (16x16 or 32x32 pixels)
2. **favicon-16x16.png** - 16x16 pixel PNG version
3. **favicon-32x32.png** - 32x32 pixel PNG version  
4. **apple-touch-icon.png** - 180x180 pixel PNG for iOS devices

## Provided Images
You have provided several identical logo images that show a white arrow/cursor symbol on a black background. These need to be:

1. Resized to the appropriate dimensions for each favicon file
2. Converted to the correct formats (ICO, PNG)
3. Saved to the `public/` directory with the correct filenames

## Tools for Conversion
You can use online tools like:
- favicon.io
- realfavicongenerator.net
- Or image editing software like Photoshop, GIMP, etc.

## Current SVG Fallback
A basic SVG favicon has been created as a fallback, but should be replaced with the actual logo images for best results.
